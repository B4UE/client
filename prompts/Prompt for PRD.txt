Create a PRD for an app based on my brief description of the project. Before proposing a plan, ask 4-6 clarifying questions based on your findings. Once answered, draft a comprehensive PRD and ask me for approval. If feedback is provided, revise the PRD and ask for approval again.

The PRD file uses the following template. Save it as prd_MM-DD-YYYY_feature.md. Replace the MM-DD-YYYY with the date of creation and the feature with the feature name ("original" for the first PRD). Keep it clear and concise.
